Hourly rates are highly dependent on task but expect to be quoted around $200 per hour for our services.


We are willing to support time and material, time-bound, cost+, and firm fixed price contracts.  Before any engagement, both parties will agree on the scope and pricing structure.

<br>
To help reduce the amount of billable hours while working with us, we suggest you:
1. Provide any supporting documentation during contract negotiations
2. Set clear goals and expectation within the standard operating procedure (SOP)
